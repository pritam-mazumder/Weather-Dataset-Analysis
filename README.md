# The Weather Dataset

The weather dataset provided encompasses a comprehensive time-series dataset, meticulously capturing per-hour data on various meteorological parameters at a specific geographical location. This extensive repository includes meticulously recorded information such as temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, atmospheric pressure, and prevailing weather conditions. With its rich granularity and breadth of data, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for in-depth analysis and insights into local weather patterns and trends over time.
  

## In this weather analysis notebook (Weather Dataset Analysis.ipynb), the key findings are:

- Identifying and extracting all the unique wind speed values.
- Determining the total occurrences of clear weather conditions.
- Determining the number of instances where the wind speed was recorded as exactly 4 km/h.
- Identifying all the null values in the dataset.
- Renaming the column name 'Weather' of the dataframe to 'Weather Condition'.
- Calculating the mean visibility from the given dataframe.
- Calculating the standard deviation of pressure from the given dataframe?
- Calculating the variance of the relative humidity values in the dataframe.
- Identifying and documenting all occurrences of recorded snow.
- Calculating the standard deviation of pressure from the given dataframe?
- Calculating the variance of the relative humidity values in the dataframe.
- Identifying and documenting all occurrences of recorded snow.
- Identifying all occurrences where the wind speed exceeds 24 and the visibility is exactly 25.
- Calculating the mean value of each column grouped by weather condition.
- Determining the minimum and maximum values of each column in relation to weather conditions.
- Displaying all records in which the weather condition is classified as fog.
- Identifying all occurrences wherein the weather conditions are classified as clear, or the visibility measures above 40 units.
- Identify instances where:
A. weather is clear and the relative humidity exceeds 50
OR
B. visibility is above 40
